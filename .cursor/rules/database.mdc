description: when you want to do something with the database - create a new table, migration, etc.
globs: 
---
- use drizzle.
- all models are defined in a model.ts in their respective module
- all model.ts files imported in the [model.ts](mdc:src/modules/model.ts)
- no sql migrations are necessary, dont create them. drizzle is setup to work from the model exclusively
- always prefer the sql style drizzle like db.insert(someTable). never use db.query.someTable.
