Never delete comments unless they are made redundant. For example, if there is a // todo comment, that you have just solved, you may delete it. but if there is a comment (todo or otherwise) completely unrelated to what you're doing, DO NOT DELETE IT. Dont touch comments unless they are now incorrect.

Always add JSDocs to Server Actions, Domain Classes, Interfaces, complex types, and so on. 

Dont go beyond the scope of what was asked of you.
