## Crypto

Crypto will continue to make a strong comeback.
The recent approval of a BTC ETF means a lot more people will become comfortable
investing into BTC, and they will have direct access to investment.
This will spill over into the larger crypto market.

Here is the value that cryptos provide to the world
- provide a store of value
- provide an audit trail
- provide private transactions
- store certificates,proofs,data
- execute a transaction (currency+data)
- execute a smart contract
- couple a transaction to a utility

The issue with most of these is that they have not found any
non-crypto industry users. for instance smart contracts are primarly used by 
other crypto companies who create tokens on top of the infrastructure,
which in turn are used by other companies to create tokens infrastructure.

There has been some adoption of crypto currency for the purpose of 
Gaming, Gambling, Art (money laundering), file storage, and some others.
None of these are substantial yet.

For this reason, considering the use of crypto currency
projects as part of a diversification strategy is mostly nonsensical.

So here are the buckets I use to define a diversified portfolio:
- Mass Market Adoptability
- Institutional Backing
- Ecosystem Capture
- Technological Advancement
- Unsanctioned Economy (Money Laundering / Drug Trade / Ransomware)
- Shovel Sellers
- Applications

Here are my selections:

BTC - Bitcoin has the clear advantage of having the largest market cap, most brand recognition, the first to market and some other advantages. most importantly, it is the one that the late movers will adopt. This falls under the category of mass market adoptability, institutional backing. 

ETH - Ethereum has achieved a lot of ecosystem capture. Most of the cryptocurrencies out there are built on top of it. Like Bitcoin it has a lot of brand recognition within the tech community, but not much outsidfe of it. The development of the tech has been slow.

SOL - Solana is the most promising major blockchain from a technical perspective, it has a nice developer experience and they made some smart choices. It is also the best performing in terms of transaction speed and has low costs. 

XMR - Monero is the primary currency used by criminals on the internet due to its privacy focused design. It is the most respectable fully private crypto. As long as people do crime on the internet, this will continue to be popular.

Staking in Validator - Validators earn an income from validating transactions on crypto networks. They need to have cryptocurrency "staked", meaning parked not doing anything in order to validate transactions. This is like the new crypto mining. These are the shovel sellers.

Staking in Exchanges / Liquidity Providers - You can also buy stocks of an exchange like coinbase, or stake coins in a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. This is also a shovel seller:
    - UNI (uniswap.org) - an ethereum based DEX, I got $20,000 free from them before.
    - OSMO (osmosis.zone) - built on cosmos, allows exchange between any blockchain not just ethereum tokens like UNI
    - CRV (curve.fi) - a stablecoin exchange
    - 1inch - aggreggates all the dexes

Layer 0 - Cosmos or Polkadot allow blockchains to communicate with each other

WLD - worldcoin is OpenAIs project to provide universal basic income for people by verifying their identity.
