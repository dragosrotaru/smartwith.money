The average difference in net worth from rent vs buy tells us the most likely
outcome, since we cannot predict the parameters

1. max vibe score
2. max average net worth in 5 years
3. max underpriced - neighbouring house prices adjusted per sqft, land size, rooms, age, condition, location (schools, distance to POI) vs house asking price
4. max cashflow in 5 years
